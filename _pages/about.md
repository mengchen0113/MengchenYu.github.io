I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Hunan University in 2025, under the supervision of Prof. Xiangyun Long and Prof. Chao Jiang. I obtained my M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from Hunan University in 2021 and my B.Eng. in Transportation from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2018. My research interests include intelligent damage assessment, intelligent perception, physics-informed machine learning, and uncertainty analysis.
